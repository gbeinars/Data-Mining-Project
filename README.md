# Predicting-Volcano-Explosivity-Index
Final Project for DSC 550: Data Mining

A case study on volcanoes was conducted and the resulting data was used for this project. Various factors, including
volcano type, location, eruption category and evidence, elevation, population, last eruption year and VEI (volcano
explosivity index). </p> </p>
Can elevation and location predict the VEI?

EDA, data cleaning, transformation, one hot encoding, training split, logistic regression, confusion matrix
